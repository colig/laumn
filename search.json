[{"authors":["Bodong Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" Let\u0026rsquo;s be clear, ethics should not be an after-thought in a learning analytics application. But what do ethical practices in the field entail is not always clear.\nWhile research ethics considers principles such as confidentiality, privacy, and informed consent, a learning analytics project may not be considered research at all (if its goal is not to produce generalizable knowledge). However, expansive collection of learning data, increasing cases of \u0026ldquo;black-box algorithms,\u0026rdquo; and more direct impact on learners necessitate some serious conversations about ethics in learning analytics.\nLast week\u0026rsquo;s discussions have already touched upon many questions about ethics. This week, we are going to dive into ethics, algorithmic accountability, and system integrity.\nWeek 3 Readings  Prinsloo, P., \u0026amp; Slade, S. (2017).

He has recently delivered a keynote on this topic in Scotland. He has graciously allowed me to embed his slides on our course website:\nZombie categories, broken data and biased algorithms: What else can go wrong? Ethics in the collection, analysis and use of student data  \nSimon Buckingham Shum, Director of the Connected Intelligence Centre (CIC) at the University of Technology Sydney, invited us to consider \u0026lsquo;Algorithmic Accountability\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Analytic System Integrity\u0026rsquo;. Discussion of Algorithmic Accountability has been taken up by important academic associations like the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). But Simon stretches our thinking to consider \u0026lsquo;Analytic System Integrity\u0026rsquo; in learning analytics. Below is a talk he gave at the UCL Institute of Education in 2016. His team is recently working on Ethical Design Critique, which offers concrete measures to enhance ethics in learning analytics tools.\n Housekeeping Please continue to explore and articulate your Working Group project ideas. Please consider problems/goals, stakeholders, data sources, analysis, and action of your project.

Also a big shout-out to Crystal Rose-Wainstock for her #LAUMN tweet about ethics in learning analytics (below). The breadth of expertise represented in our community is truly energizing. I hope we can continue to have deep conversations within and beyond this community, and to engage in learning that\u0026rsquo;s personal to everyone of us.\nThinking about learning analytics and the ethics of big data use in education. #laumn #ci5371 pic.twitter.com/8wQgpH0OF5\n\u0026mdash; Crystal Rose-Wainstock (@crosewainstock) September 5, 2018 \nIn the spirit of \u0026ldquo;living and exploring the capacity of learning analytics,\u0026rdquo; I want to introduce an analytics tool named CROWDLAAERS developed by my UC-Denver colleagues Remi Kalir and Francisco Perez for the Marginal Syllabus project. This application, which just came out during the summer, retrieves annotations from the server and generates interesting interactive visualizations.\nFor instance, below is an overview of our own #LAUMN annotation threads. I found it quite useful for discovering threads with more (or less) participation.\nAnother example is the calendar view that tells us when we tend to make annotations.\nIt appears we were quite busy making annotations during the weekend. I believe we can do better next week \u0026ndash; working less during the weekend if possible ;-)\nWeek 2 This week we will:\n Develop a stronger grasp of the field of LA Start to explore Working Group project ideas  Video After reading and discussing the George Siemens (2013) article during Week 1, it\u0026rsquo;s worthwhile to watch a lecture George gave to a MOOC (massive open online course) on learning analytics. George is the founding president of the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR), which is the most prominent international organization of learning analytics.\n Readings This week, we will get a chance to take a closer look at this field by exploring more cases/examples and posing more questions. What problems do learning analytics seek to address? In which educational settings? At which levels of an education system? Because this field is truly inter- and trans-disciplinary, I expect us to enter this field from our unique backgrounds and contribute to the field with different perspectives.\n Buckingham Shum, S.

This course has been taught twice by myself at the University of Minnesota (in 2015 and 2016). This is the first time this course is offered fully online as a formal (non-special topics) course. As the instructor, I look forward to our adventure together this semester!\nThis week we will:\n Get familiar with the course, including its design, schedule, and tools Get to know each other Read an introductory article Discuss our diverse interests in learning analytics  The Course Syllabus First thing first, please read the course syllabus (http://bit.ly/lamn-syl) in its entirety. Leave a Hypothesis annotation or send me an email when you have any questions.\nTechnology setup An online course does not need to be about watching videos and answering quizzes. To foster rich learning experiences, we will be using several technological tools to foster social, collaborative learning. Depending on your familiarity with these tools, there could be a learning curve. So please spend time this week to familiarize yourself with them.\nZoom. We will host virtual meetings on Zoom. Please make sure your computer has Zoom installed (see the video below). Please test your Zoom setup in advance to make sure audio and video configurations work properly. You will receive a calendar invitation with details about joining our Zoom meetings.\n Slack. You will receive a link that invites you to join our Slack community. Course announcements are made on Slack. All sorts of class discussion will take place there as well. First time using Slack? Watch the video below and/or read this brief introduction to Slack.\n Hypothes.is. You should have received a link that invites you to join our Hypothes.is group. Hypothes.is is a web annotation tool that enables us to discuss readings in a contextual manner. When annotating, please make sure our group name (LAUMN) is properly selected. See this page to get started, and this page to learn about annotating together as a group.\nTwo tracks of participation This course website is openly available, allowing two tracks of participation designed for this class.\n UMN class: For UMN graduate students enrolled in the class, your participation in this class is not that different from taking another online class. You are expected to meet course requirements outlined in the course syllabus. You will have private spaces (on Slack and Hypothesis private group) for within-class communications. You can decide the extent to which you interact with colleagues outside of the class list. Open participation: For \u0026lsquo;Open Participants\u0026rsquo; who would like to follow along, you can access the same materials curated on this website. Because 90% of course readings are open-access, you will be able to annotate readings using Hypothes.is as well (using the LAUMN tag). You are also encouraged to interact with me and community members via Twitter hashtag #LAUMN.  If you have any feedback on the design, I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts.\nWeek 1 Readings  Course syllabus Siemens, G. (2013). Learning analytics: The emergence of a discipline.
