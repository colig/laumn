While two communities developed separately in the beginning, communication and collaboration between two communities (PDF) have increased over the years.\nThe overlaps and differences between two communities are nicely summarized by Siemens (2013):\n Where LA is more concerned with sensemaking and action, educational data mining (EDM) is more focused toward developing methods for \u0026ldquo;exploring the unique types of data that come from educational settings\u0026rdquo;. Although the techniques used are similar in both fields, EDM has a more specific focus on reductionist analysis (Siemens \u0026amp; Baker, 2012). As LA draws from and extends EDM methodologies (Bienkowski, Feng, \u0026amp; Means, 2012, p. 14), it is a reasonable expectation that the future development of analytic techniques and tools from both communities will overlap.\n We are diving into EDM this week by exploring its connections with LA and playing with various data mining tools used in both communities.\nWeek 6 Readings  Baker, R.

Since the dawn of the field, there have been voices arguing for the importance of learning theory in the design, development, and implementation of learning analytics. In 2015, a special section was published by the Journal of Learning Analytics on the relation between learning theory and learning analytics. In the guest editorial, Wise and Shaffer (2015, p. 5) write:\n It is an exhilarating and important time for conducting research on learning, with unprecedented quantities of data available. There is danger, however, in thinking that with enough data, the numbers speak for themselves. In fact, with larger amounts of data, theory plays an ever-more critical role in analysis.\n The notion that theory matters even more in \u0026ldquo;big data\u0026rdquo; research in education goes against what was proposed in a controversial Wired article titled \u0026ldquo;The end of theory: The data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete\u0026rdquo; (Anderson, 2008). Now there is little disagreement that learning theory is essential for learning analytics.\nBriefly speaking, there are essentially two ways theory is important for the field of learning analytics.\n1. Theory Use in Learning Analytics As a field of research and practice, learning analytics work naturally draws from all sorts of theories. As summarized by Wise and Shaffer (2015, p. 9):\n Theory gives a researcher guidance about which variables to include in a model Theory gives a researcher guidance about what potential confounds, subgroups, or covariates in the data to account for Theory gives a researcher guidance as to which results to attend to Theory gives a researcher a framework for interpreting results Theory gives a researcher guidance about how to make results actionable Theory helps a researcher generalize results to other contexts and populations  For example, self-regulated learning (SRL) is widely used in learning analytics and MOOC research. SRL as a learning theory has informed data collection, data transformation, data mining, and result interpretation.\n2. Theory Building in Learning Analytics Even more exciting to me is the possibility of building new theories of learning and teaching, based on fine-grained data analysis enabled by advanced computational methods. Learning analytics and educational data mining research could give rise to new theories. For example, whether keystroke analysis can shed light on our understanding of writing processes? Whether temporal analysis can uncover \u0026ldquo;productive\u0026rdquo; patterns of collaborative discourse?\nEqually valuable are theories of learning analytics usage in emerging socio-technical contexts. For example, as new learning analytics tools are put in the hands of instructors to aid their pedagogical decisions, domain theories of analytics use can be created (e.g., van Leeuwen, 2015).\nWeek 4 Readings This week\u0026rsquo;s readings speak in particular to theory use in learning analytics. Reading #1 is a guest editorial on temporal analysis of learning data, which discusses four critical issues that are applicable to all learning analytics work. Reading #2 provides a concrete example of using a well-established learning theory (self-regulated learning in this case) in a research study. Reading #3 (optional) is the controversial Wired article mentioned above.\n Chen, B., Knight, S., \u0026amp; Wise, A. F. (2018). Critical Issues in Designing and Implementing Temporal Analytics.

According to her bio, \u0026ldquo;Dr. Wise\u0026rsquo;s research is situated at the intersection of the learning sciences and educational data science, focusing on the design of learning analytics systems that are theoretically grounded, computationally robust, and pedagogically useful for informing teaching and learning.\u0026rdquo; Among many wise things shared by Dr. Wise, below is a recent video clip of her talking about what we need to be successful in the field of learning analytics.\n Dr. David Williamson Shaffer is the Vilas Distinguished Professor of Learning Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

But what do ethical practices in the field entail is not always clear.\nWhile research ethics considers principles such as confidentiality, privacy, and informed consent, a learning analytics project may not be considered research at all (if its goal is not to produce generalizable knowledge). However, expansive collection of learning data, increasing cases of \u0026ldquo;black-box algorithms,\u0026rdquo; and more direct impact on learners necessitate some serious conversations about ethics in learning analytics.\nLast week\u0026rsquo;s discussions have already touched upon many questions about ethics.
