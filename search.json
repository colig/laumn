[{"authors":["Bodong Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" Learning analytics are about learning, so theories of learning should not be ditched despite the data deluge that has been fueling the growth of learning analytics. Since the dawn of the field, there have been voices arguing for the importance of learning theory in the design, development, and implementation of learning analytics. In 2015, a special section was published by the Journal of Learning Analytics on the relation between learning theory and learning analytics. In the guest editorial, Wise and Shaffer (2015, p. 5) write:\n It is an exhilarating and important time for conducting research on learning, with unprecedented quantities of data available. There is danger, however, in thinking that with enough data, the numbers speak for themselves. In fact, with larger amounts of data, theory plays an ever-more critical role in analysis.\n The notion that theory matters even more in \u0026ldquo;big data\u0026rdquo; research in education goes against what was proposed in a controversial Wired article titled \u0026ldquo;The end of theory: The data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete\u0026rdquo; (Anderson, 2008). Now there is little disagreement that learning theory is essential for learning analytics.\nBriefly speaking, there are essentially two ways theory is important for the field of learning analytics.\n1. Theory Use in Learning Analytics As a field of research and practice, it is naturally learning analytics work draws from all sorts of theories. As summarized by Wise and Shaffer (2015, p. 9):\n Theory gives a researcher guidance about which variables to include in a model Theory gives a researcher guidance about what potential confounds, subgroups, or covariates in the data to account for Theory gives a researcher guidance as to which results to attend to Theory gives a researcher a framework for interpreting results Theory gives a researcher guidance about how to make results actionable Theory helps a researcher generalize results to other contexts and populations  For example, self-regulated learning (SRL) is widely used in learning analytics and MOOC research. SRL as a learning theory has informed data collection, data transformation, data mining, and result interpretation.\n2. Theory Building in Learning Analytics Even more exciting to me is the possibility of building new theories of learning and teaching based on fine-grained data analysis enabled by advanced computational methods. Learning analytics and educational data mining research could give rise to new theories of learning. For example, whether keystroke analysis can shed light on our understanding of writing processes? Whether temporal analysis can uncover \u0026ldquo;productive\u0026rdquo; patterns of collaborative discourse?\nEqually valuable are theories of learning analytics usage in emerging socio-technical contexts. For example, as new learning analytics tools are put in the hands of instructors to aid their pedagogical decisions, domain theories of analytics use are created (e.g., van Leeuwen, 2015).\nWeek 4 Readings This week\u0026rsquo;s readings speak in particular to theory use in learning analytics. Reading #1 is a guest editorial on temporal analysis of learning data, which discusses four critical issues that are applicable to all learning analytics work. Reading #2 provides a concrete example of using a well-established learning theory (self-regulated learning in this case) in a research study. Reading #3 (optional) is the controversial Wired article mentioned above.\n Chen, B., Knight, S., \u0026amp; Wise, A. F. (2018). Critical Issues in Designing and Implementing Temporal Analytics.

But what do ethical practices in the field entail is not always clear.\nWhile research ethics considers principles such as confidentiality, privacy, and informed consent, a learning analytics project may not be considered research at all (if its goal is not to produce generalizable knowledge). However, expansive collection of learning data, increasing cases of \u0026ldquo;black-box algorithms,\u0026rdquo; and more direct impact on learners necessitate some serious conversations about ethics in learning analytics.\nLast week\u0026rsquo;s discussions have already touched upon many questions about ethics.

This course has been taught twice by myself at the University of Minnesota (in 2015 and 2016). This is the first time this course is offered fully online as a formal (non-special topics) course. As the instructor, I look forward to our adventure together this semester!\nThis week we will:\n Get familiar with the course, including its design, schedule, and tools Get to know each other Read an introductory article Discuss our diverse interests in learning analytics  The Course Syllabus First thing first, please read the course syllabus (http://bit.ly/lamn-syl) in its entirety. Leave a Hypothesis annotation or send me an email when you have any questions.\nTechnology setup An online course does not need to be about watching videos and answering quizzes. To foster rich learning experiences, we will be using several technological tools to foster social, collaborative learning. Depending on your familiarity with these tools, there could be a learning curve. So please spend time this week to familiarize yourself with them.\nZoom. We will host virtual meetings on Zoom. Please make sure your computer has Zoom installed (see the video below). Please test your Zoom setup in advance to make sure audio and video configurations work properly. You will receive a calendar invitation with details about joining our Zoom meetings.\n Slack. You will receive a link that invites you to join our Slack community. Course announcements are made on Slack. All sorts of class discussion will take place there as well. First time using Slack? Watch the video below and/or read this brief introduction to Slack.\n Hypothes.is. You should have received a link that invites you to join our Hypothes.is group. Hypothes.is is a web annotation tool that enables us to discuss readings in a contextual manner. When annotating, please make sure our group name (LAUMN) is properly selected. See this page to get started, and this page to learn about annotating together as a group.\nTwo tracks of participation This course website is openly available, allowing two tracks of participation designed for this class.\n UMN class: For UMN graduate students enrolled in the class, your participation in this class is not that different from taking another online class. You are expected to meet course requirements outlined in the course syllabus. You will have private spaces (on Slack and Hypothesis private group) for within-class communications. You can decide the extent to which you interact with colleagues outside of the class list. Open participation: For \u0026lsquo;Open Participants\u0026rsquo; who would like to follow along, you can access the same materials curated on this website. Because 90% of course readings are open-access, you will be able to annotate readings using Hypothes.is as well (using the LAUMN tag). You are also encouraged to interact with me and community members via Twitter hashtag #LAUMN.
