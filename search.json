As the instructor, I look forward to our adventure together this semester!\nThis week we will:\n Get familiar with the course, including its design, schedule, and tools Get to know each other Read an introductory article Discuss our diverse interests in learning analytics  The Course Syllabus First thing first, please read the course syllabus (http://bit.ly/lamn-syl) in its entirety. Leave a Hypothesis annotation or send me an email when you have any questions.\nTechnology setup An online course does not need to be only about watching videos and answering quizzes. To foster rich learning experiences, we will be using several technological tools. Depending on your familiarity with these tools, there could be a learning curve. So please spend time this week to familiarize yourself with them.\nZoom. Please make sure your computer has Zoom installed. We will host virtual meetings on Zoom.
