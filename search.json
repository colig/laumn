Since the dawn of the field, there have been voices arguing for the importance of learning theory in the design, development, and implementation of learning analytics. In 2015, a special section was published by the Journal of Learning Analytics on the relation between learning theory and learning analytics. In the guest editorial, Wise and Shaffer (2015, p. 5) write:\n It is an exhilarating and important time for conducting research on learning, with unprecedented quantities of data available. There is danger, however, in thinking that with enough data, the numbers speak for themselves. In fact, with larger amounts of data, theory plays an ever-more critical role in analysis.\n The notion that theory matters even more in \u0026ldquo;big data\u0026rdquo; research in education goes against what was proposed in a controversial Wired article titled \u0026ldquo;The end of theory: The data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete\u0026rdquo; (Anderson, 2008). Now there is little disagreement that learning theory is essential for learning analytics.\nBriefly speaking, there are essentially two ways theory is important for the field of learning analytics.\n1. Theory Use in Learning Analytics As a field of research and practice, learning analytics work naturally draws from all sorts of theories. As summarized by Wise and Shaffer (2015, p. 9):\n Theory gives a researcher guidance about which variables to include in a model Theory gives a researcher guidance about what potential confounds, subgroups, or covariates in the data to account for Theory gives a researcher guidance as to which results to attend to Theory gives a researcher a framework for interpreting results Theory gives a researcher guidance about how to make results actionable Theory helps a researcher generalize results to other contexts and populations  For example, self-regulated learning (SRL) is widely used in learning analytics and MOOC research. SRL as a learning theory has informed data collection, data transformation, data mining, and result interpretation.\n2. Theory Building in Learning Analytics Even more exciting to me is the possibility of building new theories of learning and teaching, based on fine-grained data analysis enabled by advanced computational methods. Learning analytics and educational data mining research could give rise to new theories. For example, whether keystroke analysis can shed light on our understanding of writing processes? Whether temporal analysis can uncover \u0026ldquo;productive\u0026rdquo; patterns of collaborative discourse?\nEqually valuable are theories of learning analytics usage in emerging socio-technical contexts. For example, as new learning analytics tools are put in the hands of instructors to aid their pedagogical decisions, domain theories of analytics use can be created (e.g., van Leeuwen, 2015).\nWeek 4 Readings This week\u0026rsquo;s readings speak in particular to theory use in learning analytics. Reading #1 is a guest editorial on temporal analysis of learning data, which discusses four critical issues that are applicable to all learning analytics work. Reading #2 provides a concrete example of using a well-established learning theory (self-regulated learning in this case) in a research study. Reading #3 (optional) is the controversial Wired article mentioned above.\n Chen, B., Knight, S., \u0026amp; Wise, A. F. (2018). Critical Issues in Designing and Implementing Temporal Analytics.

She is an Editor in Chief of the Journal of Learning Analytics and an Associate Editor of the Journal of the Learning Sciences. According to her bio, \u0026ldquo;Dr. Wise\u0026rsquo;s research is situated at the intersection of the learning sciences and educational data science, focusing on the design of learning analytics systems that are theoretically grounded, computationally robust, and pedagogically useful for informing teaching and learning.\u0026rdquo; Among many wise things shared by Dr. Wise, below is a recent video clip of her talking about what we need to be successful in the field of learning analytics. She is also scheduled to deliver a webinar on Oct 16 2019 about Designing Learning Analytics for Humans with Humans.\n Dr. David Williamson Shaffer is the Vilas Distinguished Professor of Learning Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He is known for his work on game-based learning and Epistemic Network Analysis. Below is a keynote speech he delivered at the 2018 Learning Analytics and Knowledge conference in Sydney, where he summarized his idea of \u0026ldquo;quantitative ethonography\u0026rdquo; and ways to tackle theory scarcity in the age of \u0026ldquo;big data.\u0026rdquo;\n Housekeeping Please continue to explore and articulate your Working Group project ideas on Knowledge Forum.

But what do ethical practices in the field entail is not always clear.\nWhile research ethics considers principles such as confidentiality, privacy, and informed consent, a learning analytics project may not be considered research at all (if its goal is not to produce generalizable knowledge). However, extensive collection of learning data, increasing cases of \u0026ldquo;black-box algorithms,\u0026rdquo; and more direct impact on learners necessitate some serious conversations about ethics in learning analytics.\nLast week\u0026rsquo;s discussions have already touched upon many questions about ethics. This week, we are going to dive into ethics, algorithmic accountability, and system integrity.\nWeek 3 Readings  Prinsloo, P., \u0026amp; Slade, S. (2017).

He has recently delivered a keynote on this topic in Scotland. He has graciously allowed me to embed his slides on our course website:\nZombie categories, broken data and biased algorithms: What else can go wrong? Ethics in the collection, analysis and use of student data  \nSimon Buckingham Shum, Director of the Connected Intelligence Centre (CIC) at the University of Technology Sydney, invited us to consider \u0026lsquo;Algorithmic Accountability\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Analytic System Integrity\u0026rsquo;. Discussion of Algorithmic Accountability has been taken up by important academic associations like the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). But Simon stretches our thinking to consider \u0026lsquo;Analytic System Integrity\u0026rsquo; in learning analytics. Below is a talk he gave at the UCL Institute of Education in 2016. His team is recently working on Ethical Design Critique, which offers concrete measures to enhance ethics in learning analytics tools. (And he is scheduled to visit UMN this October! Details soon.)\n \u0026ldquo;Living\u0026rdquo; with Learning Analytics Last week, we introduced CROWD LAAERS designed for Hypothes.is.\nThis week, I encourage you to explore KF\u0026rsquo;s list of analytic tools (see below) that can be accessed via the Assessment button. They are developed by colleagues from various countries. Note that we\u0026rsquo;re using the newest version of KF and colleagues are still revamping many of these analytic tools based on earlier versions. So they are not always user-friendly. If you have ideas that can make them better, consider turning your ideas into a course project and I will try to connect you with the right colleagues to realize your ideas.\nHousekeeping Continuing to Consider Groups Please continue to explore and articulate your Working Group project ideas. Please consider problems/goals, stakeholders, data sources, analysis, and action of your project. Continue to comment on each other\u0026rsquo;s ideas on KF and don\u0026rsquo;t be shy about saying \u0026ldquo;Our ideas are like cousins. Let\u0026rsquo;s team up.\u0026rdquo;\nPlease start to consider which Special Interest Group(s) you\u0026rsquo;re interested in.

As we try to survive all those acronyms, here is a community glossary you can look at and contribute to.\nWhat is apparent to myself is that the breadth of expertise represented in our community is truly energizing. I hope we can continue to have deep conversations within and beyond this community, and to engage in learning that\u0026rsquo;s personal to everyone of us.\nIn the spirit of \u0026ldquo;living and exploring the capacity of learning analytics\u0026rdquo; (see the Syllabus), I want to introduce an analytics tool named CROWD LAAERS developed by my UC-Denver colleagues Remi Kalir and Francisco Perez for the Marginal Syllabus project. This application, which just came out last year, retrieves annotations from the server and generates interesting interactive visualizations.\nFor instance, after authenticating yourself using your Hypothes.is API token, you will be able to choose our group and have a bird-eye view of our annotation activities. I found the Threads section quite useful for discovering threads with more (or less) participation. You can click on a particular thread to filter the data.\nAnother example is the calendar view that tells us when we tend to make annotations.\nIt appears we were quite busy making annotations during the weekend. I believe we can do better next week \u0026ndash; working less during the weekend if possible ;-)\nWeek 2 This week we will:\n Develop a stronger grasp of the field of LA Start to explore Working Group project ideas  Video After reading and discussing the George Siemens (2013) article during Week 1, it\u0026rsquo;s worthwhile to watch a lecture George gave to a MOOC (massive open online course) on learning analytics. George is the founding president of the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR), which is the most prominent international organization of learning analytics.\n (Note: Great questioning during Week 1 on whether the definition(s) of learning analytics have changed over the years. I encourage you to keep this question alive as we dig into more readings, interact with scholars like George on Twitter, or tweet such questions to the #LearningAnalytics hashtag.)\nReadings This week, we will get a chance to take a closer look at this field by exploring more cases/examples and posing more questions. What problems do learning analytics seek to address? In which educational settings? At which levels of an education system? Because this field is truly inter- and trans-disciplinary, I expect us to enter this field from our unique backgrounds and contribute to the field with different perspectives.\n Buckingham Shum, S.

Let the community know when you find a case that matches perfectly with your interests, stretches your imagination of learning analytics, or concerns you for whatever reasons.\nThis week, I encourage you to be very intentional about tags you use in Hypothesis annotations. Several ground rules I\u0026rsquo;d like to propose to our collective tagging to help us better index our ideas:\n Let\u0026rsquo;s include # in our tags (e.g., #question) Let\u0026rsquo;s use lowercase (e.g., #sharing), unless the tag is a named entity (e.g., #LMS) Let\u0026rsquo;s not include spaces, but use underscore (_) instead (e.g., #data_mining instead of #data mining)  Reminder: If you are a UMN participant, when annotating with Hypothes.is, please make sure the LAUMN-2019 group is selected. If you are not sure about annotating PDFs, please refer back to tutorials in Week 1.\nExploring Working Group project ideas While/after reading, draft a project idea based on your interests and post it on Knowledge Forum. At this point, it is totally okay if your project idea is more or less vague. This is an opportunity for us to learn more about our interests, receive feedback, and form project teams.\nAfter posting your project idea, please read and build on each other\u0026rsquo;s contributions if you\u0026rsquo;re also interested or have questions/suggestions.\nNot sure how to create or build on a Knowledge Forum contribution, watch this video tutorial (note the UI may look different as we\u0026rsquo;re using a more recent version of the software):\n Pro tip: In Knowledge Forum, you will see a searchable list of Hypothesis annotations from our community. You can either drag an annotation to form a new note, or drag an annotation into an existing note. You can use this feature if your project idea is grounded in the readings.\nBelow are a list of example project ideas.

Leave a comment or send me an email when you have any questions.\nTechnology setup An online course does not need to be about watching videos and answering quizzes. To foster rich learning experiences, we will be using several technological tools to foster social, collaborative learning. Depending on your familiarity with these tools, there could be a learning curve. So please spend time this week to familiarize yourself with them.\nZoom. We will host a number of virtual meetings on Zoom throughout the semester. Please make sure your computer has Zoom installed (see the video below). Please test your Zoom setup in advance to make sure audio and video configurations work properly. You will receive a calendar invitation with details about joining our Zoom meetings.\n Slack. You will receive a link that invites you to join our Slack community. Course announcements are made on Slack. All sorts of class discussion will take place there as well. You can also interact with course alums in some public channels.\nFirst time using Slack? Watch the video below and/or read this brief introduction to Slack.\n Hypothes.is. If you\u0026rsquo;re a formal participant, you should have received a link that invites you to join our Hypothes.is group. Hypothes.is is a web annotation tool that enables us to discuss readings in a contextual manner. When annotating, please make sure our group name (LAUMN-2019) is properly selected. See this page to get started, and this page to learn about annotating together as a group.\nKnowledge Forum (KF). If you\u0026rsquo;re a formal participant, you should have received a link and a registration key to join our Knowledge Forum community. KF is a space for collaborative knowledge building. It\u0026rsquo;s where we propose our initial (and sometimes naive) ideas and then grow them this semester. KF has a suite of analytics tools as well, so it will allows us to \u0026lsquo;live\u0026rsquo; the capacity of learning analytics while we explore this topic.\n Two tracks of participation This course website is openly available, allowing two tracks of participation designed for this class.\n UMN class: For UMN graduate students enrolled in the class, your participation in this class is not that different from taking another online class. You are expected to meet course requirements outlined in the course syllabus. You will have private spaces (on Slack and Hypothesis private group) for within-class communications. You can decide the extent to which you interact with colleagues outside of the class list. Open participation: For \u0026lsquo;Open Participants\u0026rsquo; who would like to follow along, you can access the same materials curated on this website. Because 90% of course readings are open-access, you will be able to annotate readings using Hypothes.is as well (using the LAUMN tag). You are also encouraged to interact with me and community members via Twitter hashtag #LAUMN.  If you have any feedback on the design, I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts.\nWeek 1 Readings  Course syllabus Siemens, G. (2013). Learning analytics: The emergence of a discipline.
