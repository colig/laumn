      <description>As a sister field of Learning Analytics, Educational Data Mining (EDM) emerged a few years earlier and has its own disciplinary identity (e.g., a stonger computer science focus, its own professional society, conference, and journal). While two communities developed separately in the beginning, communication and collaboration between two communities (PDF) have increased over the years.
The overlaps and differences between two communities are nicely summarized by Siemens (2013):
 Where LA is more concerned with sensemaking and action, educational data mining (EDM) is more focused toward developing methods for &amp;ldquo;exploring the unique types of data that come from educational settings&amp;rdquo;.</description>
