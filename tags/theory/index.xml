      <description>In this week, we will extend our dialogues on learning theory in Week 4 into deeper conversations about hidden assumptions in learning analytics.
This line of thinking has been greatly informed by a talk given by Simon Knight at LAK13 titled Epistemology, Pedagogy, Assessment and Learning Analytics (see slides below). Their work has evolved over the years and one reading for this week is a book chapter with a set of provocations pushing us to think more about hidden assumptions.</description>

      <description>Learning analytics are about learning, so theories of learning should not be ditched despite the data deluge that has been fueling the growth of learning analytics. Since the dawn of the field, there have been voices arguing for the importance of learning theory in the design, development, and implementation of learning analytics. In 2015, a special section was published by the Journal of Learning Analytics on the relation between learning theory and learning analytics.</description>
