      <description>Thanks for the engaged conversations in the first week of #LAUMN!
We&amp;rsquo;ve been engaged in such thoughtful dialogues via Hypothes.is annotations. We&amp;rsquo;re trying to survive all those acronyms by maintaining a community glossary. Also a big shout-out to Crystal Rose-Wainstock for her #LAUMN tweet about ethics in learning analytics (below). The breadth of expertise represented in our community is truly energizing. I hope we can continue to have deep conversations within and beyond this community, and to engage in learning that&amp;rsquo;s personal to everyone of us.</description>
