      <title>Week 3: Ethics, Algorithmic Accountability, and System Integrity</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s be clear, ethics should not be an after-thought in a learning analytics application. But what do ethical practices in the field entail is not always clear.
While research ethics considers principles such as confidentiality, privacy, and informed consent, a learning analytics project may not be considered research at all (if its goal is not to produce generalizable knowledge). However, expansive collection of learning data, increasing cases of &amp;ldquo;black-box algorithms,&amp;rdquo; and more direct impact on learners necessitate some serious conversations about ethics in learning analytics.</description>

      <description>Thanks for the engaged conversations in the first week of #LAUMN!
We&amp;rsquo;ve been engaged in such thoughtful dialogues via Hypothes.is annotations. We&amp;rsquo;re trying to survive all those acronyms by maintaining a community glossary. Also a big shout-out to Crystal Rose-Wainstock for her #LAUMN tweet about ethics in learning analytics (below). The breadth of expertise represented in our community is truly energizing. I hope we can continue to have deep conversations within and beyond this community, and to engage in learning that&amp;rsquo;s personal to everyone of us.</description>

      <description>A warm welcome to CI 5371 - Learning Analytics: Theory and Practice! This course has been taught twice by myself at the University of Minnesota (in 2015 and 2016). This is the first time this course is offered fully online as a formal (non-special topics) course. As the instructor, I look forward to our adventure together this semester!
This week we will:
 Get familiar with the course, including its design, schedule, and tools Get to know each other Read an introductory article Discuss our diverse interests in learning analytics  The Course Syllabus First thing first, please read the course syllabus (http://bit.</description>
